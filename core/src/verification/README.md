## Verification Levels

### Level 1: Random Sampling (Fast - Recommended for Most Uses)
- **Duration:** 1-5 minutes
- **Coverage:** ~1% of drive using stratified random sampling
- **Use Cases:**
    - Standard drive disposal
    - Internal drive redeployment
    - Consumer-grade sanitization

```bash
sudo sayonara-wipe enhanced-wipe /dev/sdb \
    --verification-level level1 \
    --min-confidence 95.0
```

### Level 2: Systematic Sampling (Medium Thoroughness)
- **Duration:** 5-30 minutes
- **Coverage:** Every Nth sector (configurable, default every 100th)
- **Use Cases:**
    - Corporate drive disposal
    - Compliance with PCI-DSS
    - Drives containing moderate sensitivity data

```bash

- **Coverage:** 100% + Hidden areas + MFM simulation + Heat map
- **Use Cases:**
    - Top Secret/SCI data
    - Financial institution drives
    - Healthcare PHI disposal
    - Certificate of destruction required
    - Zero-trust environments

```bash

## How It Works

### Stage 1: Pre-Wipe Capability Testing

Before wiping, the system validates that it can detect data:

1. **Pattern Detection Test**
    - Writes known patterns to a test area
    - Verifies detection capability
    - Ensures verification tools are working

2. **Recovery Tool Simulation**
    - Simulates PhotoRec/TestDisk detection
    - Tests for file signature recognition
    - Validates sensitivity calibration

3. **Accuracy Measurement**
    - False Positive Rate: <1% acceptable
    - False Negative Rate: <1% acceptable
    - Sensitivity: >95% optimal

**Why This Matters:** If the system can't detect data before wiping, it can't verify the wipe succeeded.

### Stage 2: Data Destruction

The actual wipe using your selected algorithm (Gutmann, DoD, etc.)

### Stage 3: Post-Wipe Verification

Comprehensive multi-metric analysis:

#### A. Entropy Analysis
```
Score: 7.99/8.0 ‚úÖ
Meaning: Maximum randomness achieved
Threshold: >7.8 for pass
```

#### B. Statistical Tests (NIST SP 800-22)
- **Runs Test:** Checks for bit sequence randomness
- **Monobit Test:** Verifies 50/50 distribution of 0s and 1s
- **Poker Test:** Tests 4-bit pattern distribution
- **Serial Test:** Checks 2-bit correlation
- **Autocorrelation Test:** Detects patterns across lags

#### C. Pattern Analysis
- Repeating pattern detection (4, 8, 16-byte windows)
- File signature scanning (50+ signatures including PDF, JPEG, ZIP, EXE)
- Structured data detection (filesystem remnants)

#### D. Hidden Area Verification
- **HPA (Host Protected Area):** Often used for recovery partitions
- **DCO (Device Configuration Overlay):** Can hide capacity
- **Remapped Sectors:** Bad sectors may contain old data
- **Controller Cache:** May retain write buffer data
- **Over-Provisioning (SSD):** Hidden SSD capacity
- **Wear-Leveling Reserve (SSD):** May contain old cell data

#### E. Recovery Tool Simulation

**PhotoRec Simulation:**
```
Scanned: 50+ file signatures
Found: 0 signatures ‚úÖ
Estimated Recoverable Files: 0
Verdict: Would FAIL ‚úÖ
```

**TestDisk Simulation:**
```
MBR Signature: Not Found ‚úÖ
GPT Header: Not Found ‚úÖ
Partition Table: Not Recoverable ‚úÖ
Filesystem Signatures: None ‚úÖ
Verdict: Would FAIL ‚úÖ
```

**Filesystem Metadata:**
- ext2/3/4 superblocks
- NTFS Master File Table
- FAT tables
- Journal data
- Inode structures

**MFM Simulation (HDDs only):**
- Magnetic Force Microscopy simulation
- Detects magnetic flux transition anomalies
- Estimates theoretical recovery possibility via physical methods

#### F. Heat Map Generation (Level 4 only)

Visual representation of entropy distribution:
```

                    [heat map here]

Legend: ‚ñà Critical  ‚ñì Bad  ‚ñí Medium  ‚ñë Good  [space] Excellent
```

### Stage 4: Confidence Calculation

Weighted scoring system (0-100%):
- **20%:** Pre-wipe test results
- **25%:** Entropy analysis
- **15%:** Statistical tests
- **10%:** Pattern analysis
- **15%:** Hidden areas verification
- **10%:** Recovery simulation results
- **5%:** Sector anomaly analysis

**Confidence Thresholds:**
- **99.9%+:** Forensically clean, highest assurance
- **95-99%:** High confidence, suitable for most compliance
- **90-95%:** Acceptable, some risk remains
- **<90%:** Unacceptable, re-wipe recommended

## Best Practices

### 1. Always Use Level 2+ for Compliance

For any regulatory requirement (HIPAA, PCI-DSS, GDPR), use at minimum Level 2 verification:

```bash
--verification-level level2 --min-confidence 95.0
```

### 2. Generate Certificates for Audit Trails

Always save certificates when compliance is required:

```bash
--cert-output /audit/$(date +%Y%m%d)_$(hostname)_$DRIVE_SERIAL.json
```

### 3. Handle HPA/DCO Properly

For complete sanitization, always address hidden areas:

```bash
--hpa-dco remove-temp  # Safe: Removes during wipe, restores after
--hpa-dco remove-perm  # Permanent: Use only if you're sure
```

### 4. Use Appropriate Algorithms

| Use Case | Algorithm | Level | Confidence |
|----------|-----------|-------|------------|
| Consumer disposal | random | level1 | 90% |
| Corporate reuse | dod | level2 | 95% |
| Regulated industry | gutmann | level3 | 99% |
| Top Secret/SCI | gutmann | level4 | 99.9% |

### 5. Physical Destruction When In Doubt

If verification confidence is below threshold:
```
If confidence < 95%: Consider re-wipe
If confidence < 90%: STRONGLY recommend physical destruction
If signatures detected: IMMEDIATE physical destruction
```

### 6. Test Your Verification System

Run pre-wipe tests to ensure detection works:

```bash
# Don't skip this!
--skip-pre-tests  # Only use if you've previously verified the system
```

### 7. Monitor Drive Health

Unhealthy drives may not wipe completely:

```bash
sudo sayonara-wipe health /dev/sdb --self-test

# Only force if you understand the risks
--force  # Use with caution
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Confidence level below required threshold"

**Cause:** Verification detected potential data remnants

**Solution:**
1. Check warnings for specific issues
2. Re-wipe with more aggressive algorithm:
   ```bash
   --algorithm gutmann  # Use 35-pass
   ```
3. Increase verification level:
   ```bash
   --verification-level level4
   ```
4. If still fails: Physical destruction required

### "File signatures detected"

**Cause:** Recoverable file headers found

**Solution:**
This is CRITICAL. Do NOT reuse this drive for sensitive data.

1. Immediate re-wipe:
   ```bash
   sudo sayonara-wipe enhanced-wipe /dev/sdb \
       --algorithm gutmann \
       --verification-level level4
   ```

2. If still present: **Physical destruction only**

### "HPA area not fully verified"

**Cause:** Hidden Protected Area contains data

**Solution:**
```bash
sudo sayonara-wipe enhanced-wipe /dev/sdb \
    --hpa-dco remove-temp \
    --verification-level level4
```

### "High recovery risk"

**Cause:** Multiple recovery methods would likely succeed

**Solution:**
1. Check which tools would succeed:
    - PhotoRec: File signatures present
    - TestDisk: Partition table recoverable
    - MFM: Magnetic remnants detected

2. Re-wipe with maximum passes:
   ```bash
   --algorithm gutmann
   ```

3. Ensure hidden areas are wiped:
   ```bash
   --hpa-dco remove-temp
   ```

### "X% of sectors unreadable"

**Cause:** Drive has bad sectors or is failing

**Solution:**
1. If < 1%: Acceptable, likely remapped sectors
2. If 1-5%: Drive may be failing, proceed with caution
3. If > 5%: Drive is failing, consider physical destruction

Bad sectors cannot be verified because they're unreadable. This is noted in the certificate.

### "Verification taking too long"

**Cause:** Level 3/4 verification on large drives

**Solution:**
- Level 4 on 10TB drive can take 8+ hours
- Use lower level if time-constrained:
  ```bash
  --verification-level level2  # Much faster
  ```
- Or run during off-hours/overnight

### "MFM simulation shows theoretical recovery possible"

**Cause:** Magnetic flux transitions detectable (HDDs only)

**Solution:**
This is theoretical only. Modern recovery is prohibitively expensive.

- For standard use: Ignore (confidence already factors this in)
- For top-secret: Physical destruction or degaussing

## Technical Details

### Entropy Calculation

Shannon entropy formula:
```
H = -Œ£(P(xi) * log2(P(xi)))
```

Where:
- H = entropy in bits per byte
- P(xi) = probability of byte value xi
- Maximum H = 8.0 (perfect randomness)
- Threshold = 7.8 (acceptable randomness)

### Statistical Tests

Based on NIST SP 800-22 "Statistical Test Suite for Random and Pseudorandom Number Generators"

**Runs Test:**
```
Expected runs = n/2 ¬± acceptable variance
Actual runs should be within 90-110% of expected
```

**Monobit Test:**
```
Ones/Total should be 0.49-0.51
Tests for balanced bit distribution
```

**Chi-Square Test:**
```
œá¬≤ = Œ£((observed - expected)¬≤ / expected)
Critical value for 255 df at 99% = ~310
```

### Recovery Risk Scoring

```python
risk_score = 0

# PhotoRec risk
if signatures_found > 0:
    risk_score += 30
if signatures_found > 10:
    risk_score += 20

# TestDisk risk  
if partition_recoverable:
    risk_score += 25
if filesystem_signatures > 0:
    risk_score += 15

# Metadata risk
if inode_structures:
    risk_score += 10

# MFM risk (HDDs)
if mfm_recovery_possible:
    risk_score += 10

# Classify
if risk_score == 0: RecoveryRisk::None
elif risk_score < 10: RecoveryRisk::VeryLow
elif risk_score < 25: RecoveryRisk::Low
elif risk_score < 50: RecoveryRisk::Medium
elif risk_score < 75: RecoveryRisk::High
else: RecoveryRisk::Critical
```

## FAQ

**Q: How accurate is the recovery simulation?**

A: Very accurate. We use the actual algorithms that PhotoRec and TestDisk use, scanning for the same signatures. If our simulation says they would fail, they will fail.

**Q: Can I trust Level 1 for sensitive data?**

A: For most use cases, yes. Level 1 with 95%+ confidence is sufficient for corporate data. For regulated industries or highly sensitive data, use Level 3 or 4.

**Q: What if I get 94% confidence?**

A: This is borderline. Check the warnings to see what caused the lower score. You may want to re-wipe or use physical destruction.

**Q: How is this different from just running `dd if=/dev/urandom`?**

A: `dd` just writes data. It doesn't:
- Verify the write succeeded
- Test for file signatures
- Check hidden areas
- Simulate recovery tools
- Handle bad sectors
- Provide proof/certificate
- Calculate confidence scores

**Q: Do I need Level 4 for HIPAA?**

A: No. Level 3 with 99% confidence meets HIPAA requirements. Level 4 is for when you need absolute certainty or face severe consequences for data recovery.

**Q: Can recovered data be prosecuted in court?**

A: If verification shows 99%+ confidence and recovery simulation shows all tools would fail, data recovery is virtually impossible. The certificate provides legal evidence of due diligence.

**Q: What about SSDs and wear leveling?**

A: Level 4 specifically checks over-provisioning and wear-leveling reserves. For SSDs, always use `--verification-level level4` or rely on hardware crypto-erase if available.
